This project is related to an automation regarding Excel and Google Form.
The script asks for the sheet and then inputs every line on each corresponding field of the form, sending and repeating all over again until the last data is sent.

The sheet must have 4 columns, regarding:
  1. Delivered item type
  2. Postal code
  3. Address
  4. Complement of Address

The field "Full Name" on the form is filled with the script author's name.
